Product Seed Script - Quick Help

Manual process (runs only when you execute it):

- The seed script does NOT run automatically. Run it manually when you want to add or clean products.
- Edit the `products` array in `backend/scripts/addProducts.js` to add or change product entries.

How duplicates are handled:

- Before adding a product, the script checks whether a product with the same `name` exists.
- If duplicates exist, the script keeps the newest entry and removes older duplicates.
- If a product already exists (one entry), the script skips adding it.

Commands (PowerShell) — run from the `backend` folder:

```powershell
# Run the seed script (reads backend/.env for DB_TYPE and MONGODB_URI)
node scripts/addProducts.js

# Check current products in the database (uses Node, not mongosh)
node scripts/checkProducts.js
```

Simple usage steps:

1. Open `backend/scripts/addProducts.js` and edit the `products` array to include the products you want.
2. Ensure your `backend/.env` sets the right DB (e.g., `DB_TYPE=mongodb` and `MONGODB_URI=...`).
3. From a terminal in `backend`, run `node scripts/addProducts.js`.
4. After it finishes, run `node scripts/checkProducts.js` to verify the entries.

Notes & safety:

- The script will NOT create duplicates; it skips existing names and removes older duplicates.
- If you want to force a full reset, you can remove entries manually from the DB (or modify the script to drop the collection) — do this only if you understand the consequences.
- If you don't have `mongosh` installed, use `node scripts/checkProducts.js` to inspect records.

Need more? If you'd like I can:
- Add a `--force` flag to always replace matching products
- Add a separate `reset-products` script to wipe and reseed
- Convert the product list to a JSON file so non-developers can edit it safely
